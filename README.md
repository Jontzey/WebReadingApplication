# About
This webbapplication was built and inspired by diffrent websites where you can read foreign cartoon. I made it as a small project to see what i could develop at the time. 

# To Run the app
In terminal you need to do two commands to get the whole application to work

npm run start
json-server --watch db.json --port 4000


# Packages you may need
npm install react-router-dom     (THIS package is to navigate through diffrent urls)
